Dialogue files for the same sequeunce must have the name filename, except for the suffix. 

English dialogue files end with the suffix "_eng".
Japanese dialogue files end with the suffix "_jpn".

For example, "cutscene_1_eng.json" and "cutscene_1_jpn.json" would be swapped with each other depending on the language.

If there is no recognised suffix it is considered english by default.

          If this is defined then before the sequence start it will fade the current background to the
