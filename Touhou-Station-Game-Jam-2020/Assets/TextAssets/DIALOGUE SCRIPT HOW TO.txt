Dialogue files for the same sequeunce must have the name filename, except for the suffix. 

English dialogue files end with the suffix "_eng".
Japanese dialogue files end with the suffix "_jpn".

For example, "cutscene_1_eng.json" and "cutscene_1_jpn.json" would be swapped with each other depending on the language.

If there is no recognised suffix it is considered english by default.
